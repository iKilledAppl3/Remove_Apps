# Remove System Apps
- This is a macOS bash script I made just for the sake of it. 
- This removes apps, backups apps to the desktop, or moves the apps defined by the script to a safe place.
- I made this because I saw a tweet from @mem_alloc on Twitter who had said he wanted to remove those apps (I don't really recommend removing them but hey...)

# How to use?
- Simple! Download or Clone to Desktop and open terminal then chmod +x removeapps (if needed).
- Double click the script file and it will take care of the rest.
- Need help contact me on Twitter @iKilledAppl3.

# Things to Do!
- Add the abilty for users to choose what apps they want to delete, make a backup of, or move out of the /Applications/ directory.
