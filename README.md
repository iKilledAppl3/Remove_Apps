# Remove System Apps
This is a macOS bash script I made just for the sake of it (right now it doesn't remove system apps it just moves them to the desktop) the user decides on what they want to do.
I made this because I saw a tweet from @mem_alloc on Twitter who had said he wanted to remove those apps (I don't really recommend removing them but hey...)

# How to use?
- Simple! Download or Clone to Desktop and open terminal then chmod +x removeapps (if needed).
- Double click the script file and it will take care of the rest.
- Need help contact me on Twitter @iKilledAppl3.

# Things to Do!
- Add the abilty for users to choose what to do (i.e. move apps, delete apps, or copy and make a backup then remove).
